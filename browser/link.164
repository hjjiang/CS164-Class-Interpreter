##
# Link: A link analogous to HTML's <a> tag. Its "ref" attribute points to a
# file that contains the page to be displayed when a Link is left-clicked.
# Links otherwise behave as HBoxes. Links are logical wrappers, so they have
# zero margins and paddings unless explicitly specified.
#
def Link = HBox:new({ \
  ref="", background="transparent", \
  topMargin=0, rightMargin=0, bottomMargin=0, leftMargin=0, \
  topPadding=0, rightPadding=0, bottomPadding=0, leftPadding=0 \
})

Link.pass5_BindEventListeners = lambda(self) {
  for (node in postorder(self)) {
    # In the future, it may make sense to ensure that the node is actually
    # rendered (currently this is the case for all descendants of Link).
    native runtime.addAnchorTarget({node=node, url=self.ref})
  }
}
